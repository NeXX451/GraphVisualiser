# GraphVisualiser

## Introduction

This is a console-based graph visualiser. I wanted to make a fully functional GUI, but then I discovered that writing GUIs is pure torture.



## Algorithms

The algorithms included are: Bellman Ford, BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, Kruskal, Prim's Algorithm, Single Source Shortest Path in DAGs, Strongly Connected Components and Topological Sort.





##  Flags for g++  and Cmake 
```bash
set(GCC_COVERAGE_COMPILE_FLAGS "-Wall -pedantic -Wno-long-long -O2 -Werror")   set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} ${GCC_COVERAGE_COMPILE_FLAGS}" )  
```
